## Tips for Best Results

### Camera Scanning
- Ensure good lighting on your bookshelf
- Hold camera steady for a few seconds
- Position camera so book spines are clearly visible
- Try different angles if books aren't detected

### Photo Upload
- Use high-resolution photos for better text recognition
- Ensure book spines are clearly visible and well-lit
- Avoid blurry or angled photos
- Close-up photos of individual shelves work better than full bookcase shots

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure you've granted camera permissions
- Try refreshing the page and allowing permissions again
- Check if other applications are using the camera
- Use HTTPS (required for camera access)

### Books Not Detected
- Improve lighting conditions
- Move closer to the bookshelf
- Ensure book spines are clearly visible
- Try different angles or positions

### API Rate Limits
- The app includes delays to avoid overwhelming book APIs
- If you encounter rate limits, wait a few minutes before continuing
